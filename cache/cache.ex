  Registers a function that will be computed periodically to update the cache.

  Arguments:
    - `fun`: a 0-arity function that computes the value and returns either
      `{:ok, value}` or `{:error, reason}`.
    - `key`: associated with the function and is used to retrieve the stored
    value.
    - `ttl` ("time to live"): how long (in milliseconds) the value is stored
      before it is discarded if the value is not refreshed.
    - `refresh_interval`: how often (in milliseconds) the function is
      recomputed and the new value stored. `refresh_interval` must be strictly
      smaller than `ttl`. After the value is refreshed, the `ttl` counter is
      restarted.

  The value is stored only if `{:ok, value}` is returned by `fun`. If `{:error,
  reason}` is returned, the value is not stored and `fun` must be retried on
  the next run.

  Get the value associated with `key`.

  Details:
    - If the value for `key` is stored in the cache, the value is returned
      immediately.
    - If a recomputation of the function is in progress, the last stored value
      is returned.
    - If the value for `key` is not stored in the cache but a computation of
      the function associated with this `key` is in progress, wait up to
      `timeout` milliseconds. If the value is computed within this interval,
      the value is returned. If the computation does not finish in this
      interval, `{:error, :timeout}` is returned.
    - If `key` is not associated with any function, return `{:error,
      :not_registered}`
